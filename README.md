# Molar Mass Calculator

A simple cli tool to calculate the molar mass of any molecule, built with python

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/nexusnotfound/molar_mass_calculator.git
```

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3 or higher
```

### Using
To get started, simply run [molar_mass.py](molar_mass.py). To get the molar mass of any molecule, simply write the molecular formula of that molecule, glucose for example:
```
C6H12O6
```

Which will output
```
6 Carbon (12.011 g/mol) atoms: 72.066 g/mol
12 Hydrogen (1.008 g/mol) atoms: 12.096 g/mol
6 Oxygen (15.999 g/mol) atoms: 95.994 g/mol
A total of 180.156 g/mol
```

Or Octane:
```
C8H18
```

Which gives us:
```
8 Carbon (12.011 g/mol) atoms: 96.088 g/mol
18 Hydrogen (1.008 g/mol) atoms: 18.144 g/mol
A total of 114.232 g/mol
```
